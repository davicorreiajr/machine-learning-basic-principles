# Machile Learning: Basic Principles

"CS-E3210 - Machine Learning: Basic Principles" is a subject from Aalto University, which I coursed during the months of September and October of 2018. This repository is a collection of all exercises, developed in Python thought Jupyter Notebooks, I've done during the course.

During the course, we've basically done assignments weekly (which can be found in the `assignments` folder) and, in the end, a project (of course, found in the `project` folder). More information about all the exercises can be found in the Jupyter Notebook itself.

The project was done together with [@simonedesogus](https://github.com/simonedesogus). Besides the report, one the criterias was to get a minimum in two Kaggle competitions: [accuracy](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mlbp-data-analysis-challenge-accuracy-2018) and [log-loss](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mlbp-data-analysis-challenge-log-loss-2018). Our project (identified as `Group 105` in both leaderboards) beat the benchmarks.

## Running

First, make sure you have Jupyter installed in your machine. If you don't, you can follow the instructions [here](http://jupyter.org/install).

Then, clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/davicorreiajr/machine-learning-basic-principles.git
cd machine-learning-basic-principles
```

Finally, start the Jupyter:
```
jupyter notebook
```
